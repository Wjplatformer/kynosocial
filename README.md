### Usage

#### These are instructions for setting up your own local instance for testing purposes or contribution. Unlike other open source software, Kynosocial works out of the box. You can clone the repositiory below, and then open & modify to your taste 'index.html' and 'index.js' files. However, we recommend the 'Live Server' VSCode extension.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dotargz/kynosocial
$ cd kynosocial
```

### Contributing

#### You can check out the open issues and discuss with others about them or open your own issue if you spot a problem or a feature that's currently missing, even if you can't fix it yourself.
