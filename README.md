<h4>Using Kynosocial, you can level up from Twitter, Instagram and Reddit to a clean new platform unlike any other.</h4>

## Contributing 

Take a look at the client's [open issues](https://github.com/dotargz/kynosocial/issues)! You can add to the conversations or make your own, pointing out a bug or sharing a feature idea that would make Kynosocial better.

### Usage  

Kynosocial is very **fork-friendly** so you can directly fork the repo and work on the project without much setup. Forks of the client can still interact with the backend easily. 

These are instructions for setting up your own local instance for testing purposes or contribution. Unlike other open source software, Kynosocial works out of the box. You can clone the repositiory below, and then open & modify to your taste 'index.html' and 'index.js' files. However, we recommend the 'Live Server' VSCode extension.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dotargz/kynosocial
$ cd kynosocial
```
