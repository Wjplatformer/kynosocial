Unlike other open source software, Kynosocial works out of the box. Setting up your own local instance for testing purposes or contribution is simple; just clone the repositiory with the command below, then modify the 'index.html' and 'index.js' files. We recommend using the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension if you use VSCode.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dotargz/kynosocial
$ cd kynosocial
```
