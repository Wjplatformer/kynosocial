## Contributing 

Look at [open issues](https://github.com/dotargz/kynosocial/issues) and add to the conversations or make your own to point out a bug or feature that's currently missing, even if you can't fix it yourself.

### Usage  

Kynosocial is very **fork-friendly** so you can directly fork the repo and work on the project without much setup. Forks of the client can still interact with the backend easily. 

These are instructions for setting up your own local instance for testing purposes or contribution. Unlike other open source software, Kynosocial works out of the box. You can clone the repositiory below, and then open & modify to your taste 'index.html' and 'index.js' files. However, we recommend the 'Live Server' VSCode extension.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dotargz/kynosocial
$ cd kynosocial
```
