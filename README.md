<h4>Level up from Twitter, Instagram, or Reddit to Kynosocial, a clean new platform unlike any other.</h4>

## Contributing 

Take a look at the client's [open issues](https://github.com/dotargz/kynosocial/issues)! Join in the conversation or make your own, starting with a bug or feature request to improve the platform.

### Usage  

Kynosocial is very fork-friendly âœ¨ so you can directly fork the repo and work on the project without much setup. Forks of the client can interact with the backend without changing a thing. 

These are instructions for setting up your own local instance for testing purposes or contribution. Unlike other open source software, Kynosocial works out of the box. You can clone the repositiory with the command below, then open & modify the 'index.html' and 'index.js' files. We recommend the 'Live Server' VSCode extension.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dotargz/kynosocial
$ cd kynosocial
```
